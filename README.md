# Set up
You need to have Python 3 and pip installed on your computer. Set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running
Run the debugging server with `python app.py`. You should now be able to access it at http://localhost:5000.
